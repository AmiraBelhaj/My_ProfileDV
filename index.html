Here are 3 of my main characteristics that you should be interested in: </div>
<div class="container">
	<div class="white-card">
		<h4> <strong> A PROBLEM SOLVER COMBINING DESIGN & BUSINESS SENSES üëê </strong></h4>
		<p> <strong>I perceive business design at the intersection of a great user experience and a sustainable business model. I take a holistic approach to gain a deeper understanding of customers unmet needs, then build a unique value proposition that is financially and operationally feasible.
		</p>	
		<p> For the last 3 years, I have been developing transformative solutions with a top-tier bank business lines & functions, SBF120 corporates, SMEs and Fintechs in different industries enriched by deep consumer research and insight. </strong>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="white-card">
		<h4> <strong> A CREATIVE RAISED IN MULTICULTURALISM üó∫ </strong></h4>
		<p> <strong>Brought up within a French-Moroccan culture, I perceive my international background as a genuine enrichment and openness enabling me to feel as a duck takes to water in changing environments.</strong>
		</p>	
		<p> <strong> My academic path and working experiences took me all around the world from China to the USA, through Australia and Greece. Having the opportunity to work within different contexts, disciplines, from investment banking to strategic design through humanitarian aids, I consider alternatives to the way things are currently done, and see people and situations from multiple perspectives.</strong>
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="white-card">
		<h4> <strong> A MAKER BUILDING POSITIVE INNOVATION üõ†</strong></h4>
		<p> <strong> I perceive the world as a playground offering infinite opportunities to create, learn, share and meet. As a strong believer in the saying: ‚ÄúBe the change that you wish to see in the world‚Äù, I try to build sustainable solutions to the challenges crossing my path. </strong>
		</p>
		<p> <strong> In this regard, I co-founded Habibi.Works 3 years ago, a maker space in Northern Greece designed to go beyond a strictly humanitarian approach to implement self-aid by giving the opportunity to refugees, locals and international experts to unfold their potential and build perspectives of integration.</strong></p>	
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="yellow-card">
		<strong> I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future, to share about past experiences and future projects and hopefully, together, invent, launch and scale game-changing businesses. </strong>

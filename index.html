		<h4> <strong> ZINY |</strong> A hair and beauty booking platform</h4>
		<p> <h6> <strong>Context</strong></h6></p>
		<p> BBNP Paribas and its Moroccan subsidiary launched a start-up studio with the ambition of creating a unique digital ecosystem in Morocco. A customer-centric approach was conducted to better understand the needs of digitally savvy Moroccans and 1,800 individual feedback were collected in the form of interviews, immersive sessions and focus groups. These insights helped to identify and prioritise services which could potentially improve the daily lives of Moroccans.</p>

		<p>Ziny, a hair and beauty booking platform was launched within this context.</p>	
		
		<p> <h6><strong>Challenge</strong></h6></p>
		<p>How to facilitate the user beauty booking experience while simultaneously helping salons to manage their business digitally on-the-go 24/7, all in one place? </p>
	
		<p> <h6><strong>Expertise provided</strong></h6></p>
		<p>User Research | Service & UX design | Product design | Go-to-market </p>

		<p><h6><strong>Design Process</strong></h6></p>
		
		<p> <strong>Research & interviews:</strong> Through research (industry, regulatory and technology trends) and interviews (interviewing 40 potential users and 10 beauty salons), 2 areas of focus were identified:
		<ul>
  			<li> The booking experience from the customer point </li>
			<li> The agenda management from the salon side </li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Concept creation:</strong> The client-team and potential users were then involved in co-creation sessions to validate customer insights and hypotheses (personas, pain journey and challenges) and in ideation sessions to define target solution scenarios. The drawn concepts were then prioritised and made tangible through service mock-ups (service blueprint).</p>

		<p><strong>Concept testing:</strong> Concept testing: A deep dive was then carried out on the key features of the solution to challenge their relevance and feasibility, as well as the sustainability of the selected business model (subscription fees) with both internal and external experts.</p>

		<p><strong>Concept launch:</strong> The refined concept was then pitched to key stakeholders (executive management, potential partners, target users) to kick off the venture launch and built an MVP roadmap (solution architecture, partner strategy, growth plan). This integrated user and expert feedback.</p>

		<p><h6><strong>The solutionâ€¨</strong></h6></p>
		<p>In this regard, we developed Ziny, the first Moroccan 24/7 beauty bookings platform that puts customers and salon managers in control.</p>

		</video>
		</p>
		<p>Today, Ziny is currently on an experimental phase in Casablanca, Morocco, offering to its community the opportuiny to book among 20 certified beauty partners. For the next two months, we will iterate on the solution based on its clients insights and feedback. </p>

		<p>A parallel territory is under study for this pilot phase in Marrakech to measure the contrast between the market appetite of the two different towns.</p>

		<p> <h6><strong>Personal Learnings</strong></h6></p>
		<p> <ul>
  				<li>A strong bootstrap culture within the Moroccan entrepreneurial ecosystem</li>
  				<li> Regulatory reluctance to digital payment soultions due to strict money laundering politicies</li>
 				<li> The contrast between the high Moroccan digital penetration rate and the limited financial inclusion rate</li>
			</ul>

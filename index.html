		<h4> <strong> ZINY |</strong> A hair and beauty booking plateforme</h4>
		<p> <h6> <strong>Contexte</strong> </h6></p>
		<p> BBNP Paribas and its Moroccan subsidiary launched a start-up studio with the ambition of creating a unique digital ecosystem in Morocco. A customer-centric approach was conducted to better understand the needs of Moroccans and 1,800 individual feedback were collected in the form of interviews, immersive sessions and focus groups. These insights helped to identify and prioritise services which could potentially improve the daily lives of Moroccans.</p>

		<p>Ziny, a hair and beauty booking platform was launched within this context.</p>	
		
		<p> <h6><strong>Challenge</strong></h6></p>
		<p>How to facilitate the user beauty booking experience while simultaneously helping salons to manage their business digitally on-the-go 24/7, all in one place? </p>
	
		<p> <h6><strong>Expertise provided</strong></h6></p>
		<p>User Research | Service & UX design| Partnership on-boarding/contracting </p>

		<p><h6><strong>Design Process</strong></h6></p>
		
		<p> <strong>Research & interviews:</strong> Through research (industry, regulatory and technology trends) and interviews (interviewing 40 potential users and 10 beauty salons) 2 areas of focus were identified:</p>
		<p> 1 - User Challenge:  Time management</p>
		<p>2 - Salon Challenge: 2 different challenges according to categories of salons:
		High profile salons : Agenda management
		More modest sized salons : Visibility on the net and agenda management </p>

		<p><strong>Concept creation:</strong> The client-team and potential users were then involved in co-creation sessions to validate customer insights and hypotheses (personas, pain journey and challenges) and to ideate target scenarios with them. The concepts were then prioritised and made tangible through service mock-ups (service blue print).</p>

		<p><strong>Concept creation:</strong> Concept testing: A deep dive was then carried out on the key features of the solution to challenge their relevance and feasibility, as well as the sustainability of the selected business model with both internal and external experts.</p>

		<p><strong>Concept launch:</strong> The refined concept was then pitched to key stakeholders (executive management, potential partners, target users) to kick off the venture launch and built an MVP roadmap (solution architecture, partner strategy, growth plan). This integrated user and expert feedback.</p>

		<p> <h6><strong>Personal Learning</strong></h6></p>
		<p> <ul>
  				<li>A strong bootstrap culture within the Moroccan entrepreneurial ecosystem</li>
  				<li>Cultural & regulatory constraints related to the Moroccan market</li>
 				<li>Moroccans appetite for digital services</li>
